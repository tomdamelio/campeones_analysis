## Testing & Quality

### Rules
- Framework: **pytest** + **pytest-cov** (target ≥ 90 % on core code).
- Add **hypothesis** tests for critical numerical routines.
- Integration test: minimal end-to-end run with toy dataset (< 10 s).
- Run **pyright** in the test session (`pytest --type-check`) via pytest-pyright plugin.

### Checklist
- [ ] `pytest -q` passes locally and in CI.
- [ ] Coverage report ≥ 90 % lines for `src/project_name/**`.
- [ ] At least one Hypothesis strategy in the suite.
